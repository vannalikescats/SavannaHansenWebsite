      <h2>Who is VannaLikesCats?</h2>
      <p> Hi! I'm <b>Savanna Hansen</b>, and yes I do indeed like cats! 
      </p>
      <p> I recently relocated to <b>Indian Rocks Beach, Florida.</b> I previously lived in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Denver, Colorado </li>
          <li> Rockton, Illinois </li>
          <li> Greenville, South Carolina</li>
          <li> Poplar Grove, Illinois </li>
          <li> Beloit, Wisconsin </li>
        </ul>
      
      <p> I come from a <b>fine art</b> background, run 2 family <b>businesses</b>, am a <b>graphic designer</b>, and recently decided to get into <b>computer programming</b>.
      </p>

        <h2>About Me:</h2>

        <p> Besides being a avid feline enthusiast, I really enjoy the great outdoors! I loved hiking the mountains of Colorado, and exploring the beaches and oceans of Florida! I have a very creative mindset, and am extremely detail orientated. In my spare time I enjoy drawing, staying physically fit, and helping others.  
        </p>

        <p> I've studied a vast range of majors while furthering my education:
          <ul>
            <li>Rock Valley College</li>
              <ul> 
                <li> Associates Degree in Fine Art </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Rockford University</li>
              <ul>
                <li> 3D Art: Ceramics </li>
                <li> Graphic Design </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Thinkful</li>
              <ul> 
                <li> Software Engineering </li>
              </ul>
          </ul>

        <p> At 16, I started my first business <a href="https://getyourbowon.com/"> Get Your Bow On! </a> 
        </p>

        <p>
        3 years ago I started my second business <a href="https://savage-creations-co.myshopify.com"> Savage Creations Co. </a>
        </p>

        <p> Through graphic design, I found my love for working with computers. After having to put together websites for my businesses with great programmers, I decided I wanted to take the next step and learn how to create my own from scratch. That led me to look into computer programming and software engineering, and I came across coding bootcamps. I am only within my first month of the course, but learning Javascipt, HTML, and CSS has blown my mind! I can't wait to continue on and further my knowledge. With my design background, I am very excited to work my way into the UX / UI platform, and hopefully in the future acquire a job in the field working alongside other great programmers!
